A major tenant of scientific inquiry is the reproducibility of experimental evidence. With this in mind, we have set out to reproduce some important results from Ahn's 1995 paper titled "Measuring the Value of Children by Sex and Age Using a Dynamic Programming Model."  This paper's main contribution is that it was the first attempt to estimate the "economic value" (in terms of money) of children to their parents using a dynamic discrete choice framework. The basic idea is that the parent faces a known income profile of their life and in each period of their life cycle they receive utility from two sources: their income and the number of children they have (which is age and gender dependent). Therefore during each fertile period, the parents decide whether to have a child or not by maximizing their expected total life cycle utility. 


This paper will first outline the main elements Ahn's model and then describe our computational methodology for reproducing panels c and d from Table 5b on p. 374 of the paper. Panel c shows the choice probabilities if the boys and girls have the same values. Panel d shows the choice probabilities if the average values of boys and girls are used in the estimation.

The Model:

An example of an ExtremeValue class DDP:
$\zeta $ specification: ex ante additive extreme value errors enter U()

Clock: NormalAging (finite horizon, ends in period T)

Action: $\alpha$ = (d), d.N = 2 , the binary decision to have a child or not in a fertile period.

Endogenous State:
$\theta = (nb, dvals) $ , nb.N = 8, dvals[i].N = 2
 
dvals[i] is the decision of whether to have a child in period i (where $0 \leq i < \tau $)
nb is the number of boy children that a woman has.

Transition: 
If t is a fertile period ($ t \leq \tau = 7 $) then number of boys next period is either 0 or 1 boys more.

nb' = nb + (1-d)*(probability of having a son)

If t is not a fertile period ( $ \tau < t $) then nb remains constant. 
nb' = nb

Semi-Endogenous: none

Endogenous: none

Utility: The value of composite good, $x_t$, which is made up of income and the current value of existing boy and girl children (which is not constrained to be the same).

$ U_t = log(Y_t + \sum_{k=0} ^{t-1} (b_{k+1} m^t _{t-k-1} + g_{k+1} f^t _{t-k-1}) + \zeta_t(d_t)$
where $Y_t$, denotes the couple's income at $t$, and $b_t, (g_t)$ takes a value of one if the couple has a male (female) birth at t and zero otherwise.  Meanwhile, the value of a $k$-period-old boy (girl) at time t is denoted as $m^t _k (f^t _k)$. It is assumed that the couple may have at most one child per period   (p. 336). The error term $\zeta_t(d_t)$ is the standard IID extreme value shock.

Note: due to the negative values of boys and girls at young ages $log(x_t)$ was negative in some cases. To resolve this issue we implemented a minor change to the utility function:

$ V_t = max(1, U_t) $ , effectively bounding the utility function above zero.

The age and gender dependent values of the children are then estimated from fertility data of Korean couples in the 1980s.

For our project, we use the estimated values of the children from the paper to calculate the choice probability of giving birth for college educated Korean women using the niqlow DDP solver. More specifically, we aim to replicate the results from panels c and d from table 5b on p. 374 of the paper. Panel c shows the choice probabilities if the boys and girls have the same values. Panel d shows the choice probabilities if the average values of boys and girls are used in the estimation. 
The main reason for choosing these panels is that Ahn's approach requires keeping track of both the ages and gender of the children. To do this in niqlow would require creation of a new derived StateVariable class but other aspects of the original model mean the gap between it and the approximation is small. Instead, niqlow can keep track of the actions taken using the ChoiceAtTbar class and this together with a separate state variable for the number of boys allows us to keep track of the total number of children, the total number of boys and girls and the age of the children (but not the age of each gender) in each period. In the Utility() method, setting the local variable bg=1 will give estimated probabilities for panel c and setting bg=0.5 will give the estimated probabilities for panel d. The actual and estimated probabilities are shown in the following table. 

[INSERT TABLE]

As shown in the table above, we cannot replicate the results from Ahn at this moment. We have printed out the decision variables, state variables, income and utility from each period and each reachable state and they seems to have been calculated, so we are uncertain what is causing the discrepancies. One thing that is not clear from the paper is that the utility is the log of the sum of income and number of children which could be negative, so there must be some adjustment made for these states and we are unsure what that is (we set all values below 0 to 1 before taking log).
